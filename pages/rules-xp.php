<h3>Getting and Spending Experience Points</h3>
<p>
  Experience points are used by the GM to reward player characters. How much XP a character gets over time is
  for the GM to decide. Several models are thinkable. The simplest one would be to award a fixed amount of
  points after a gaming session (for example 3 points per character). You can also make XP a function of time
  played (for example giving them 1 point for every hour of gaming) or employ your own scheme that takes into
  account how the characters did overcome specific challenges.<br/>
  <br/>
  By spending these experience points (XP), the players can increase their characters' attributes, 
  health status scores, and skill ratings during the character's lifetime. 
  As it gets harder to progress further in an area, it costs more XP to do so. 
</p>

<h3>Raising Attributes</h3>
<p>
  To raise an attribute by one point, spend XP equal to the new rating of the attribute, times three. 
</p>

<h3>Acquiring a New Skill</h3>
<p>
  Count the number of skills where the character currently has a rating of 1 or more, times two, this will be the cost of acquiring a new skill. 
  Note that this cost does not apply when a character is being created, only when the character progresses later during the game this cost is applied.
</p>

<h3>Raising a Skill Rating</h3>
<p>
  To raise a Skill rating by one point, spend XP equal to the new rating of the Skill. 
</p>

<h3>Raising HP, EP, MS</h3>
<p>
  To raise a Health Status score by one point, spend a number of XP equal to the new score.
