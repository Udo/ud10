<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>
  This is a set of rules designed for a pen and paper roleplaying game, which is – in short – a form of social entertainment where a group of players experiences through the actions of fictional characters an interactive story being told by another person, also called the game master (GM). Since this is a barebones rulebook we'll assume that you are familiar with the concept of roleplaying games. If you are not, Google is your friend! 
</p>
<p>
  UD10 is supposed to be a very bare-bones and simple rulebook for (almost) any kind of roleplaying scenario. While simple in nature, it is also 
  designed to allow the GM and players enough freedom of expression to play a rich and nuanced game.

<h2>Dice Rolls</h2>

<h3>Determining success and failure</h3>
<p>
  One of the fundamental principles of this set of rules is the die roll with a d10 (ten-sided die), to perform an action which is called 
  a <i>check</i>. Checks are done in order to determine the success or failure of an action a character is performing. Checks are performed 
  with a <i>rating</i>. The rating is a value that describes how good a character is at doing something (the higher the better). How high 
  this rating is for various checks will be described later. 
  The d10 result rolled plus the character's rating determines the result of the check. 
  A die roll result of 1 is always considered a failure. A die roll of 10 is always repeated and the results get added together.
</p> 

<h3>Comparative Checks</h3>
<p>
  When several characters or NPCs interact, often two or more rolls need to be compared against each other to determine a winner. In this 
  case, the roll with the highest end result wins. If a draw occurs during combat, the defender wins.
</p>

<h3>Difficulties</h3>
<p>
  Actions have varying degrees of difficulties. To reflect that, the GM (usually) announces the minimum result a player must roll to 
  succeed beforehand. You can use the following table as a reference when it comes to determine the difficulty of a check:	
  <pre>
    A monkey could do it:   5	
    Easy task:             10
    Normal task:           15
    Difficult task:        20
    Nearly impossible:     25+
