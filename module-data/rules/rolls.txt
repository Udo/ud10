#Dice Rolls

##Determining success and failure
One of the fundamental principles of this set of rules is the die roll with a d10 (ten-sided die), to perform an action which is called a <i>check</i>. 
Checks are done in order to determine the success or failure of an action a character is performing. 
Checks are performed with a <i>rating</i>. The rating is a value that describes how good a character is at doing something (the higher the better). How high 
this rating is for various checks will be described later. The d10 result rolled plus the character's rating determines the result of the check. 
A die roll result of 1 is always considered a failure. A die roll of 10 is always repeated and the results get added together.

##Comparative Checks
When several characters or NPCs interact, often two or more rolls need to be compared against each other to determine a winner. In this case, the roll with the highest end result wins. If a draw occurs during combat, the defender wins.

##Difficulties
Actions have varying degrees of difficulties. To reflect that, the GM (usually) announces the minimum result a player must roll to succeed beforehand. You can use the following table as a reference when it comes to determine the difficulty of a check:	

    A monkey could do it:   5	
    Easy task:             10
    Normal task:           15
    Difficult task:        20
    Nearly impossible:     25+
