##Thaumatocracy

Thaumatocratic societies are ruled by a wizard caste. Typically, the use of magic is tightly regulated and subject
to state approval. Depending on the nature of the rule caste, this system can range from being autocratic, to (in rare cases)
bordering on rationalism.

Characters from a thamatocratic background receive a bonus of 1 to their INT attribute.
