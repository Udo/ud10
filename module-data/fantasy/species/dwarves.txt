##Dwarves

Diverged from humans a long time ago, Dwarves are a sturdy and industrious species. The tend to form small and close-knit groups that stay together for decades. By nature, dwarves are usually reserved but also very passionate.

Dwarves come of age at 30 to 40 years. Without advanced medical intervention, a Dwarf's natural lifespan is between 300 and 500 years. Dwarves have a high resistance to innate and genetic diseases and can sometimes thrive in environmental conditions unsuitable for most other humanoids.

On character creation, a dwarf starts with CON 2, STR 2, DEX -2, and INT 0. Dwarves have an innate ability to resist diseases and poison, and gain the Resistance: Toxins and Radiation skill at +4. When buying skill and attribute points with XP, dwarves always pay 2 points more than normal for any single advancement.
