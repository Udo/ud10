#Alchemy

Alchemy is the art of transforming matter into other kinds of matter, changing both the structure of materials, as well as their chemical composition and physical properties. 
Advanced Alchemists can even transform elements into other elements.

##Basic Spells

###Weakness
<pre>Level: 1, Speed: 1, Duration: concentration,
  Area: personal, Max Level 10</pre>

The Weakness spell reduces the durability of solid materials, temporarily transforming them into a brittle or even mushy substance.
The maximum amount of material that can be weakened is 2^[Level] kg. When targeting armor, its effectiveness is halved by this spell.

###Strength
<pre>Level: 2, Speed: 1, Duration: concentration,
  Area: personal, Max Level 10</pre>

This spell strengthens materials, effectively making them more rigid and resistant to damage. The maximum amount of material that 
can be strengthened is 2^[Level] kg. When targeting armor, its effectiveness receives a bonus of +2 due to this spell.
