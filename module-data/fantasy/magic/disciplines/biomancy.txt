#Biomancy

Biomancy is the art of manipulating biological matter in a way that suits the wizard.

##Basic Spells

###Boost
<pre>Level: 1, Speed: 1, Duration: concentration,
  Area: personal, Max Level 7</pre>

This spell boosts either the STR, DEX or CON attribute of the target by 1 point. At Level 4, this boost is 2 points, and from Level 7 on it is 3.

###Pain
<pre>Level: 2, Speed: 1, Duration: none,
  Area: personal, Max Level 7</pre>

The pain spell inflicts neurally induced suffering upon an enemy life form. The life form must make a CON check
against the wizard's power roll. If the wizard wins, the creature suffers from unspeakable pain for [Level] rounds
and gets a -2 penalty on all checks. The spell also causes [Level] points of EP damage.

###First Aid
<pre>Level: 3, Speed: 1 - [Level], Duration: none,
  Area: personal, Max Level 9</pre>

With the First Aid spell, a character can intervene to save a critically wounded life form. The spell stops
arterial bleeding and heals one point of damage for every 4 [Levels]. The First Aid spell cannot be
applied more than once on the same wound.
