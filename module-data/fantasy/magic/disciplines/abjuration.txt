#Abjuration

Abjuration is the art of directing energy away from something. Thus it forms the basis for most types of
protection magic.

##Basic Spells

###Magic Shield
<pre>Level: 1, Speed: reaction, Duration: none,
  Area: personal, Max Level 5</pre>

The wizard surrounds herself with a protective force field, absorbing [Level] points of damage from an attack.

###Protection Circle
<pre>Level: 2, Speed: 1 round per m circumference, Duration: concentration
  Area: circle of up to 2^[Level]m radius, Max Level 10</pre>

The magic circle must be traced on the ground beforehand, leaving a physical outline behind using a suitable material
such as crystalline metal oxides. Activating a pre-existing circle (or reactivating it) takes only a normal action.
Creatures trying to cross the boundary of a magical circle must make an INT check against the wizard's Level+INT or
be unable to do so. If they succede in making that check, they take d10+[Level] damage as they cross the barrier.
The Protection Circle also absorbs any damage-inflicting effect crossing its boundary, subtracting
[Level] points from any attack. 

###Heat Resistance
<pre>Level: 3, Speed: 1, Duration: concentration, 
  Area: personal, Max Level 10</pre>

This spell grants the wizard or an ally temporary resistance to excessive heat as emitted by weapons or other
phenomena, subtracting [LEVEL] points of damage from each attack.

###Break Momentum
<pre>Level: 4, Speed: reaction, Duration: none,
  Area: personal, Max Level: 5</pre>
  
With the spell, the wizard can break the momentum of a moving object, such as a projectile or even a falling person,
stopping it in its track and preventing impact damage. The maximum mass of the object is 10^[Level] kg, for example
10kg in the first level, 100kg in the second, and so on. The wizard must be able to see the object.
