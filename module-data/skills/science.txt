##Basic Knowledge
[INT / untrained] The basic knowledge skill represents the character's general education level. Check rolls against this skill can be used to determine whether a character possesses any general contemporary piece of knowledge, though â€“ like any roll - this check might get assigned a modifier by the GM to indicate the difficulty level.

##Astronomy

##Biology
[INT] With this skill, the character can analyze and classify organisms, evaluate the behavior and physiology of organisms, perform and understand biological experiments.

##Chemistry

##Mathematics
[INT] With this skill, the character develops a profound understanding of the science of general physics and mathematics, as appropriate to the given campaign setting.

##Physics
[INT] The character has an understanding of the guiding principles of physcis, as well as the mathematical underpinnings required to do advanced calculations based on them.

##Pseudoscience (specify)
