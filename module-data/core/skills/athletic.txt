#Athletic Skills+

##Acrobatics
[DEX] Allows the character to perform gymnastics and advanced movement maneuvers. A successful Acrobatics check can also reduce falling damage by half.

##Athletic Pool
[pool] This pool skill provides a buffer of points that can be used to raise a character's defense rating for one combat round, and it can be used to boost any skill belonging to the athletic group. The player must announce the number of points she wants to use to boost the defense rating at the character's initiative turn. The defense rating then stays boosted until the character's next action in the following combat round. The defense pool regenerates between fights.

##Endurance
[CON / untrained] In a situation where the character might lose one or more endurance points, a check against the Endurance skill may be performed. If successful the loss of EP is halved if the check succeeds, but at minimum one EP is drained in any case.

##Initiative
[DEX / untrained] The initiative skill represents the character's ability to react swiftly in challenging situations. During a fight, each participant has to roll a d10 and add their initiative rating in order to determine when they can perform an action relative to the other participants. Simple check rolls on initiative can be performed to indicate readiness or quickness of a character's reaction in a crisis situation.

##Swim
[CON / untrained] Checks against this skill can be made to determine the outcome of swimming maneuvers. It is assumed that most people are adept enough at swimming to keep themselves afloat and moving even if they do not have the Swim skill.
