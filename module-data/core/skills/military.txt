#Military Skills+

##Command
[CON or INT] Characters with the command skill can efficiently lead a unit of underlings. Checks on the command skill are appropriate to determine the outcome of a shared acitivity, to coordinate group members, or to bring them back in line during a time of crisis.

##Drill Pool
[pool] This pool represents a reservoir of points usable to bolster routine skills that are in alignment with the characters mission. The pool replenishes at the start of each gaming session.

##Hide
[DEX / untrained] To hide herself, other people, or objects from unwanted discovery, checks against this skill are performed.

##Military Tactics
[DEX] This skill provides additional expertise for use in military combat situations, especially where team play is required.

##Move Silently
[DEX / untrained] Checks against this skill can be performed to determine the outcome of the character's attempt at silent movement.

##Quick Draw
[DEX] To draw a weapon as a free action, the character makes a check against her Quick Draw skill. The difficulty for this is 10 for small weapons, 15 for medium weapons, and 20 for large weapons. For modern automatic weapons, the difficulty rises by 5 points to load a cartridge into the chamber (but switching the safety off is free). Readying a shield in addition to a melee weapon also raises the difficulty by 5. The GM is free to apply additional situational modifiers. If the check is unsuccessful, the maneuver takes up a normal action.

##Search
[INT / untrained] Checks against this skill can be performed to search an area for certain items or characteristics.
