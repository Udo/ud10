#Making a Character

This section describes how to quickly create a character. The method of character creation can vary between
settings. This describes the default way of making a player character or NPC.

##Basic Steps

1 - First, write down the 4 <a href="/rules-attributes">attributes</a>: 
STR, DEX, CON, and INT. All of those have a rating of zero points. You may now distribute 5 points 
among those, but no single attribute may be higher than 3.

2 - Now it's time for the <a href="/rules-health">health status scores</a>: HP, EP, or MS. They start at 10 
each. You may distribute another 5 points among those, but no more than 3 points per status score.

3 - You probably want to decide beforehand what your character is supposed to be like. Decide on a job, or any 
stereotype you might want to realize here. Keep this in mind when distributing your points. You can refer to 
the stereotypical dispositions further down on this page.

4 - While it is up to the GM to decide how many points you get to spend in order to create your character, 
you now normally get 10 points to buy <a href="/rules-skills">skills</a>. Each point gets you a new skill 
or raises an existing skill by 1. To ensure new characters are balanced, no skill may exceed a rating of 3 
during character creation though.

##Dispositions

<p>Here is a list of dispositions that may fit your character, you may choose one from each category, or if you feel
like it roll 4d6 to determine them randomly:</p>

##Applying Templates
Templates are pre-fabricated archetypes that can be applied to your character, depending on the setting you're playing in. 
Choosing a template will cost a number of points that you would otherwise spend on acquiring skills.
A template will contain a set of bonuses to attributes and skills that your character gets to start with. 
Bonus points from templates are applied after the freely assignable experience points for character generation are spent. 

What templates are available depends on the setting you want to play in (the same applies to the selection of skills). 

##Making Your Own Templates
  Templates are a good way to emulate the classical "character classes" found in many roleplaying systems.
  To encourage players to base their characters on a template while still giving them complete freedom,
  the point sums provided by templates are a bit cheaper than they would be if you created a similar character
  from scratch. As a rule of thumb, add the skill points of a template together, then add the double of
  all attribute bonus points and take 75% of the resulting sum as the cost for that template:
    Template cost = [(sum of skill points) + (2 x sum of attribute bonuses)] * 0.75
