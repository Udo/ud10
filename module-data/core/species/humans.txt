##Humans

Humans are versatile and flexible, but in the grand scheme of things, not terribly good at any particular thing. They are a diverse race with warlike traits, prone to easy political and religious manipulation. However, these properties do not necessarily apply to every human individually. 

Humans typically enter full adulthood between 16 and 20 years of age. Without advanced medical intervention, humans can expect to reach an age of only 60 to 90 years. Humans have a mid-range procreation rate that soars in lean conditions and drops off sharply with rising lifestyle and security. Infant mortality is very high. Humans are very susceptible to diseases, so on average they require intense medical treatment for most of their lives. 

On character creation, humans do not receive any attribute modifications or special skills.
