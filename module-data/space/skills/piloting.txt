#Piloting Skills+

##Pilot Small Spacecraft
[DEX] This piloting skill qualifies a character to fly a number of small shuttle-like spacefaring craft appropriate to the campaign setting. 

##Evasive Maneuvers
[DEX] With this skill, a character can perform evasive maneuvers with her small spacecraft in order to avoid getting hit with weapons fire or other high-velocity impactors. Use this skill as a reaction to dodge when piloting small spacecraft during a combat situation.

##Pilot Large Spacecraft
[INT] Large Spacecraft are not flown by the seat of the pilot's pants, instead they are carefully maneuvered. Controlling a large space-faring vessel requires a talent for planing and foresight.

##Stellar Navigation
[INT] By employing this skill, a character can navigate her spacecraft around the star system, or depending on its technological sophistication, she can even perform interstellar navigation tasks.
