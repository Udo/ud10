##Bureaucracy

The purpose of bureaucracy is to expand forever the society's administrative frameworks in an effort to meet
the needs of its expanding bureaucracy. This requires a technical level that ensures proper data archival,
but also - and perhaps more importantly - a technological background that can support a large number of the
population not doing anything productive.

Characters from a bureaucratic background receive the Bureaucracy skill with a rating of 3. They also get a 
bonus of 2 on all skill rolls that involve activities which have been carefully planned and approved by
an authority beforehand.
