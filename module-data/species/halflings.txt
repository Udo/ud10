##Halflings

Diverged from humans a long time ago, halflings are an enterprising and generally optimistic species of somewhat small proportions. By nature, halflings tend to be hedonists and collectors. 

Halflings come of age at 20 to 30 years. Without advanced medical intervention, a Halfling's natural lifespan is between 120 and 160 years. They have a middling reproduction rate.

On character creation, a halfling starts with CON 1, STR -2, DEX 1, and INT 0. Halflings receive a starting bonus of 1 for any DEX-based skill acquired during character generation, and they also get the Resistance: Fear skill at +4. When buying skill and attribute points with XP, halflings always pay 1 point more than normal for any single advancement.
