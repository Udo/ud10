##Technocracy

People living in a technocracy are defined by their use of machines for almost every aspect of life. This
includes employing machines to do all the menial tasks, as well as other vital functions such as security and 
health care. Technocracies can be stable, rationalist societies or even implementations of direct democracy
 - but they can also degenerate into unstable decadent anarchies. 

Characters from a technocratic background receive a bonus of 2 on all skill roles dealing with machines
or computer equipment.
