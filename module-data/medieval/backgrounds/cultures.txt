##Feudal

Feudal societies are characteristically headed by either a single monarch or a royal family. The entire
country is ruled by an immense pyramid of aristocrats who derive their rights and powers solely from
inheritance. This rather large and hierarchical leadership caste controls the vast masses of nearly
powerless citizen workers who are kept in a state of ignorance.  

Characters from a feudal background receive the Diplomacy and Rules and Regulations skills at a rating of 3.
The also get a bonus of 1 to either their Ranged or Melee Combat skills.
